- **Delete a Freelancer**: Remove a freelancer from the directory.
- **Update Freelancer Details**: Modify the details of an existing freelancer.
- **List Freelancers**: Retrieve a list of registered freelancers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [MySQL Server](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/zhihow2002/CDN.git


2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
cd CDN

3. Restore the .NET packages:
dotnet restore

4. Update the database with the latest migrations:

dotnet ef database update --project CDN.Infrastructure

5. Start the API project:

dotnet run --project CDN.API


The API should now be running on `https://localhost:5007`.

## Usage

You can interact with the API using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or by visiting the Swagger UI at `https://localhost:5007/swagger`.

## Running the Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:


Creating a README file for your project is a great way to introduce and explain your project to potential users or contributors. Below is a template that you can use as a starting point for your CDNProject README. You'll need to customize it with specifics about your project, how to set it up, and how to use it.
